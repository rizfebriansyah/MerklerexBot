# MerklerexBot

I created a command-line user interface and a simulation of the Merklerex exchange that enables a human to engage in trading activities like offering and accepting trades, performing market analysis, and so forth.

I have been given the task of developing a bot that can trade automatically on the Merklerex platform. In essence, the bot replaces the human by interacting with the exchange and performing tasks that you would have previously performed manually by selecting items from the menu.
